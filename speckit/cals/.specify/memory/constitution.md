# speckit-cals Constitution

## Core Principles

### Specification-First Development
All features and implementations begin with a clear, written specification that defines requirements, acceptance criteria, and expected behavior before any code is written.

### Test-Driven Development
Tests are written before implementation code, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to ensure all functionality is properly validated from the start.

### Continuous Integration
All code changes are integrated continuously, with automated testing to catch regressions and ensure system stability.

### Code Quality Standards
All code must meet established quality standards, including proper documentation, adherence to style guides, and passing all linting and quality checks.

### Observability and Monitoring
Systems must be built with proper logging, metrics, and tracing to enable debugging, monitoring, and performance optimization.

### Security First
Security considerations are integrated from the beginning of development, with regular security testing and vulnerability assessments.

## Additional Constraints
All dependencies must be regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities. Use of open-source libraries requires approval and security review.

## Development Workflow
All code changes require peer review before merging. Feature branches must pass all tests before being eligible for review.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development practices. Amendments require documentation in an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) and approval from project maintainers.
