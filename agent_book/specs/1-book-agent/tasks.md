## Dependencies Summary

- Phase 1 (Setup) must be completed before starting any other phase
- Phase 2 (Foundational) depends on Phase 1 completion
- User Stories can be developed in parallel after Phase 2 completion
- US1 (Reading Companion) has no dependencies on other user stories
- US2 (Search) has no dependencies on other user stories
- US3 (Explanations) may benefit from US2 (search) for context retrieval
- US4 (Summarization) may benefit from US2 (search) for content retrieval
- US5 (Learning Tools) may benefit from US2 (search) and US3 (explanations) for content processing

## Parallel Execution Examples

1. **Within US2**: T042-T044 (upload and processing) can run in parallel with T045-T048 (RAG implementation)
2. **Across stories**: US3, US4, and US5 can be developed in parallel after Phase 2 completion
3. **Frontend and Backend**: Frontend components can be developed in parallel with backend APIs (using mock data)

## Implementation Strategy (MVP First)

**MVP Scope (Usable Product)**: Complete Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 (US1 - Reading Companion). This delivers core value of tracking reading progress and resuming reading.

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. MVP: US1 (Reading Companion) - Core value proposition
2. Version 1.1: Add US2 (Search capability) 
3. Version 1.2: Add US3 (Explanation capability)
4. Version 1.3: Add US4 (Summarization) and US5 (Learning Tools)
